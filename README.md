# FRC 2025 Reefscape Season
Code for the 2025 FRC season, reefscape. 

## Handy Tricks
Use `CTRL + Shift + P` to bring up options specific for WPILib in vscode. Some useful commands are:
- Build Robot Code - Make sure the code compiles and doesn't have errors
- Manage Vendor Libraries - Used to add new libraries. These are added with a URL to a `json` file 
- Simular Robot Code: Run a simulation of the robot in a GUI. Useful for testing first versions of new features

## Debugging
To debug the robot in a simulation place a breakpoint in the side of the code editor (click to the left o the line number so a red dot appears). To debug the robot live set breakpoints as needed and use the `Debug Robot Code` option in the WPILib command list
